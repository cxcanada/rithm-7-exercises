# Hashing-Sessions

### Part 1

Continue building on the simple authentication app from the [curriculum](https://github.com/rithmschool/python_curriculum/blob/master/Unit-03/03-hashing_cookies_sessions.md). Add a `show` page and an `edit` page for your users. Make it so that you can view any user's show page, provided you're logged in, but you can only access your own edit page, not anyone else's.

### Part 2

Add user authentication to an application you've already built! The code shouldn't be so different from what you've seen, you'll just have to integrate it into a preexisting application. See how much you can do without referencing the curriculum.
