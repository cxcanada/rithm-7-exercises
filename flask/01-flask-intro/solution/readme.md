# Flask Basics

For this assignment you will be creating a very small flask application. Your application should:

- have a route for `/welcome`, which responds with the string "Welcome"
- have a route for `/welcome/home`, which responds with the string "Welcome home"
- have a route for `/welcome/back`, which responds with the string "Welcome back!"

### Bonus

Add another route to `/sum` and inside the function which sends a response, create a variable called `sum` which is equal to 5+5. Respond with the sum variable.
