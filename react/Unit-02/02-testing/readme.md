# Testing a React Application

For this assignment you will be adding tests to your Todo application [from the previous repo](https://github.com/rithmschool/react_exercises/tree/master/02-props-state-component-architecture/react-components).

 Make sure all of your components are tested using the following:

- Snapshot testing
- Enzyme for testing shallow rendering (and mounting if necessary)
