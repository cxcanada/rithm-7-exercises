# Express CRUD

For this exercise we will be building a simple application where we will store a shopping list. You should use an **array** to store your items in the shopping list.

## Part 1

Our application should have the following routes:

1.  `GET /items` - this should render a list of shopping items.
1.  `POST /items` - this route should accept form data and add it to the shopping list.
1.  `GET /items/:id` - this route should display a single item's name and price
1.  `PATCH /items/:id`, this route should modify a single item's name and/or price
1.  `DELETE /items/:id` - this route should allow you to delete a specific item from the array.

## Part 2

Build a front-end for your application! Using AJAX, display the list of items and allow a user to add an item, remove an item and update an item. You can do this using jQuery or vanilla JS.
